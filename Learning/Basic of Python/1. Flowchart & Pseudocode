Symbols for flowchart :

1) Terminator : used for either start or stop the program. --> oval shape
2) Parallelogram : used for input & output from program. --> Parallelogram shape
3) Rectangle : used to show process that is executed. --> rectangle shape

Pseudocode : is a way of writing or describing programming code or algorithms in a natural language such as english. ( Pseudocode are similarly written as algorithm but not in a form of diagram )


Example 1 : Take input of two numbers, sum it and get output.
Steps : 1) Input a, b   2) Sum   3) Output
Pseudocode : Start, take inputs a & b, make a variable sum insidee which add a & b, print sum variable, Stop.


Example 2 : Take input n and sum till n.
Steps : 1) Taking input n   2) sum = 1+2+3...+n   3) Ouput sum
Pseudocode : Start
                Ask the user to enter a number n
                set sum = 0

                for i = 1 to n
                    Add i to sum
                end for

                print the value of sum
              Stop
